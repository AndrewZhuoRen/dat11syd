This repository will contain all the slides, labs, homework and projects for the course. The materials for each class will be posted before each class and you can `git pull` the repo to get the updated files or download the zip file.

You can either download the repository as a zip or clone the repository to you local machine using...

```
git clone https://github.com/generalassembly-studio/dat10syd.git

```

The course will be written in python 3.6 and jupyter notebooks. The best way to get setup with python is to download the anaconda package from this address [https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos). 

## Windows Users
Please note there is extra work for Windows users. Windows does not natively have a real bash terminal which has lots of nice data wrangling features (although the new Windows has an Ubuntu Linux Terminal it is missing some features). To account for this I recommend choosing one of the following guides to install a bash terminal.

### Beginner Windows Users [Cygwin]
You can install Cygwin (https://cygwin.com/install.html) which is a bash emulator and does a great job.

### Intermediate Windows Users
For intermediate users, I recommend installing Oracle's [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and installing [Ubuntu 16.04](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) as having a Unix OS gives you access to a bunch of useful features.

### Advanced Windows Users
For advanced users I recommend using a Docker instance of Ubuntu with all the packages installed such as https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/datascience-notebook or by running the command:  

```
docker pull publicisworldwide/data-science-python
```  

Please note this will require you to setup and configure Docker to use the Ubuntu instance. Here is a Docker install guide https://becominghuman.ai/docker-for-data-science-part-1-dd41e5ef1d80.
